    "With the increasing volume of animals picked up by urban animal control centers, understanding and predicting the outcomes of these incidents have become crucial for effective management and resource allocation. In this study, we leverage a comprehensive 7-year dataset from Baton Rouge Animal Control and Rescue Center (ACRC) to develop a supervised machine learning model that predicts the disposition of animals based on a variety of characteristics such as incident date, request type, location, species, breed, sex, size, age, condition, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to, with the help of this dataset, be able to predict the behaviour of each animal species depending on the time of the year and other factors such as location, to subsequently predict how many animal controllers should be attending each call and possibly help them decide the tools to use and how to perfomr in each task. This supervised predictive model can aid in prioritizing resources, optimizing intervention strategies, and ultimately improving the welfare of animals within urban communities.\n",

    "The results of our study will not only contribute to a deeper understanding of the factors influencing animal outcomes but will also provide a practical tool for other animal control centers to anticipate the disposition of animals in their care. "
